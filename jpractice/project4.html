		 <div class="drink">  Legend has it that the original Crystal Pepsi was formulated to taste just like normal Pepsi and later gave way to a citrus-flavored spin-off soda... which leads to the question: what does the new Crystal Pepsi taste like? We got our hands on a 6-pack to party like it's 1993. And we were pretty surprised.  </div>

		   <div class="apps"> A Brief history of appetizers. The dishes we served prior to the main course are designed to whet the appetite and set the tone for the meal. They occupy the mind and belly while dining guests wait for the centerpiece that will satisfy their hunger to the fullest.

		 You might be familiar for the French name for appetizers: Hors d’oeuvre. While “appetizer” refers specifically to building the appetite, Hors d’oeuvre literally means, “outside of the masterpiece.” Don’t you love this? It is as though we are on the threshold, waiting for a revelation that can only be experienced once we come inside. Food is art.

		   <div class="desserts"> Deserts, The history of desserts is more than just a mere recounting of the first ice cream cone or the first time meringue was served. Sweets date back to ancient civilizations where people enjoyed fruits and nuts candied with honey. However, desserts as are commonly known today became popular through an evolution of technology and culinary experimentation.

						   Ice Cream

			Ice cream can be dated as far back as 3000BC and perhaps was the first "dessert" in the sense in which it is known today. Ice cream was actually an invention of the Chinese, however, it was much more of a flavored ice than it was truly an ice cream. While Marco Polo may have brought the ice cream making technique to Europe from his travels, it was Catherine de Medici that made sorbet in fashion in Italy. While the exact point at which flavored ices became ice cream as it is generally thought of today, is not known; however, by the mid-1800's recipes for how to make ice cream were in wide circulation.
